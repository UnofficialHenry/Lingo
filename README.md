    1. To start the game user has to press the “START” button
    2. The game board shows up, the first letter of the word is revealed, user has 5 attempts to guess the hidden word
    3. The user has to insert a word in the input field and press the “SUBMIT” button next to the input field
    4. Word that user inserted shows up in the first row- letters that are in the correct position shows up green; letters that the word contains but are not in the correct position are black; letters that do not exist in the word are red
    5. If all letters are green- the user guessed the word with 1st guess and earns 100 points. The new game board shows up and the user can guess the next word. Points are counted together for all rounds
    6. If all letters are not green, the user has to make 2nd guess
